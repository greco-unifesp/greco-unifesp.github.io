  abstract={The promises of multipath transport are to aggregate bandwidth, improve resource utilization, and enhance reliability. In this paper, we demonstrate that the way multipath coupled congestion control is defined today leads to a suboptimal resource utilisation when network paths are disjoint, i.e., they do not share a bottleneck link. With growing interest in standardising Multipath QUIC (MPQUIC), we have implemented the practical shared bottleneck detection (SBD) algorithm from RFC8382 in MPQUIC (MPQUIC-SBD). Through extensive experiments, we evaluate MPQUIC-SBD in the context of video streaming with various Adaptive Bitrate (ABR) algorithms, addressing both ABR classes of rule-based and learning-based solutions. We demonstrate that MPQUIC-SBD accurately detects shared bottlenecks over 90% of the time, depending on the ABR algorithm, as the size of the video segments increases. In non-shared bottleneck scenarios, when MPQUIC-SBD detects that its QUIC subflows do not share the same network resources, it decouples their congestion windows accordingly, enabling video throughput gains of up to 37% compared to MPQUIC. These gains translate directly into improved video quality metrics, including higher bitrate, better resolution, and reduced buffering, resulting in an enhanced quality of experience for users.},

  abstract = {Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC) is a promising paradigm that provides cloud computing services closer to vehicular users. In VEC, vehicles and communication infrastructures can form pools with computational resources to meet vehicular services with low-latency constraints. These resource pools are known as Vehicular Cloud (VC). The usage of VC resources requires a task scheduling process. In this case, depending on its complexity, a vehicular service can be divided into different tasks. An efficient task scheduling needs to orchestrate where and for how long such tasks will run, considering the available pools, the mobility of nodes, and the tasks deadline constraints. Thus, this article proposes an efficient VC task scheduler based on an approximation heuristic and resources prediction to select the best VC for each task, called MARINA. MARINA aims to analyze the behavior of vehicles that share their computational resources with the VC and make scheduling decisions based on the mobility (VC availability) of these vehicles. Simulation results under a realistic scenario demonstrate the efficiency of MARINA compared to existing state-of-the-art mechanisms in terms of the number of tasks scheduled, monetary cost, system latency, and Central Processing Unit (CPU) utilization.},

  abstract={Rapid advancements in vehicular technology and increased vehicle modernization have led to the emergence of intelligent and interconnected entities. As a result, the Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC) paradigm has gained prominence. This paradigm enables the provision of cloud computing services close to vehicular users by utilizing the idle computational resources of vehicles to execute tasks that require computing power beyond what is available locally. Aggregating these computational resources in the vehicular context is known as Vehicular Cloud (VCloud) formation. However, leveraging and aggregating these resources poses several challenges due to the dynamic nature of the vehicular environment. One of the main challenges is the efficient selection of vehicles to assume management roles in the distribution of computational power within the group, often referred to as leading vehicles. This research presents a mobility-aware mechanism called PREDATOR to enhance the VCloud formation process. In this mechanism, the Roadside Unit (RSU) provides vehicular mobility predictions, enabling the selection of the most stable vehicles within the RSU coverage area to assume leadership roles in the VCloud. In this context, vehicle stability is associated with a vehicleâ€™s time within the RSU coverage area, known as dwell time. PREDATOR employs a microscopic perspective to select vehicles with the longest dwell time in the VCloud, allowing for efficient management of computational resource utilization. Simulation results have demonstrated that PREDATOR not only increases the VCloud lifetime but also minimizes leader changes, reduces network message exchange, mitigates packet collisions, and facilitates the effective utilization of aggregated vehicular resources compared to state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract={The concept of a fully connected world in the fifth generation technology envisions the massive rollout of small and constrained Internet of Things (IoT) devices. In such IoT environments, machine-to-machine (M2M) communications is key for allowing these devices (e.g., sensors, actuators, smart meters/monitors) to collect data toward a remote server. We address this particular scenario by building and evaluating an IoT multi-access reference architecture, with a multipath TCP (MPTCP) gateway connected to multiple cellular networks to offload M2M data traffic. Experimental results from CoAP-emulated traffic indicate that the our proposed system together with the benefits of MPTCP improve IoT application performance. More specifically, multipath-based M2M data traffic offloading increases throughput and significantly reduces latency of CoAP requests as the number of sensor networks increases.},
